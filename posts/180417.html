	  <p>On April 10, Mark Zuckerberg was questioned by congress about the facebook incidents around data sharing with Cambridge Analytics. During the the questioning the following sequence came up and we were much reminded about our development strategy for Dynamo.</p>
	  <p> From a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-testimony.html">NY times article</a>: 'Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip, asked if Facebook’s motto is still “move fast and break things.” Mr. Zuckerberg said it has been revised. “I don’t know when we changed it,” Mr. Zuckerberg replied, “but the mantra is currently ‘move fast with stable infrastructure,’ which is a much less sexy mantra.” He appeared to be joking, eliciting laughs from the executives sitting behind him.'</p>
	  <p>We can affirm the development in Dynamo follows the new Facebook motto: 'move fast with stable infrastructure'.</p>
