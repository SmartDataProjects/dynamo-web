	    <p>Today we decided to finally go public and put up a web site for Dynamo, our dynamic data management solution.</p>

	  <p>It was in 2014 when we decided to start developing a data management tool for CMS to address the aparent issue with the existing tool (phedex).</p>
	  <p>While the software has a sophisticated setup to define various owner groups and their permissions for various people to manage the data for the specific group of people, phedex has no automatic tools that would manage the data in some intelligent way. The intelligence was provided by the various data managers for each physics group that would manage a subset of sites (typically three to five Tier-2 sites per physics group).</p>
	  <p>This concept worked fine for the first years, but it turned out to be resource intensive both in terms of the people maintaining the datasets as well as in the space usage. Our goal was to develop a software that would have a global view of the system and make intelligent global decisions substantially reducing the partitioning of the storage system in terms of physics groups and space reservations per site. In addition coordination between various physics groups concerning common samples would be eliminated, removing all unwanted duplication of data.</p>
	  <p> Initially we designed this program on top of the existing phedex tools, as they were mostly doing what they were supposed to do. Over the years our software has become more and more involved and phedex turned out to be a bottleneck. We finally decided to gradually replace phedex, first by helping it do its job better and eventually phasing it out.</p>
	  <p> This is how we got to start a more substantial programming effort which finally in November 2017 resulted in the basic design for Dynamo which was completed in February 2018.</p>
